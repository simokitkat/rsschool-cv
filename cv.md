### Summary:

I'm a passionate junior front-end programmer who worked shortly in tourism and then worked in the customer support field in different sections (technical support, reservations and holiday bookings and financial markets), but then, **_I discovered the wonderful world of programming & web developing and decided to shift my career to front-end developing._**

I'm so eager to learn more and more everyday and that's another reason why I like web developing, that **_you can never stop learning!_** I hope I'll become a full-stack developer someday.

### Code Examples:

**DESCRIPTION:**
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

**Note:** If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

**_Solution:_**

```
    function solution(number){
    const arr =[];
    for (i = 3; i<number; i++){
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0){
    arr.push(i);
    }else if (number < 0){
    return 0;
    }
    }
    const arr1 = arr.map(function(el){ return el }).reduce(function(acc,curr){ return acc + curr },0);
    return arr1;
    }
```
